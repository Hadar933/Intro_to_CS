==================
PART A  - SUDOKU
I have solved the sudoku using 5 functions:
1.find_vacant(board,lst): runs over the given board and searches indexes
that has zero in them. the index will then be added to a list

2.in_row(board,row,num):
checks if the number that is given can be inserted in the given row,
considering the laws of sudoku

in_col(board,col,num):
checks if the number that is given can be inserted in the given column,
considering the laws of sudoku

in_zone(board,row,col,num):
checks if the number that is given can be inserted in the given zone,
considering the laws of sudoku. The zone is consisted of sqrt(n) x sqrt(n)
cubes.

safe_location(board,row,col,num):
this function returns a boolean value whenever all of the 3 previous function
return that the position is "safe"

solve_sudoku(board):
this function is responsible for the recursive run, that eventually solves
the sudoku, using all previously mentioned functions.

PART B
in this part, all of the functions are similarly made:
each question is being answered using three seperate functions that each
has its own unique task. one functions is responsible for the recursive run,
the other for the manipulation of the return or the print that is needed,
and the other is responsible for the creation of the list if needed.
