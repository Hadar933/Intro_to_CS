I discussed the exercise with: Metargelim.

web pages I have used:

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
1.input list: multiple user inputs are inserted to a single list
2.concat list: adds components from string list to a new list
3.maximum: check for biggest number in a list of numbers (using loop)
4.cyclic: determines whether a list is a cyclic permutation of
          another list.
5.seven boom: switches every number that has 7 in it or is divisible
          by 7 with the word 'boom'
6.histogram: with a given list and a number n, the function creates a new
             list mentioning how many times an int was shown and in which
             position
7.prime factors: finding all prime factors of a single number. also shows
                 how many times the same prime factor is being used.
8.cartesian: using loop, the function creates the cartesian product of two
           given lists.
9.pairs: check if any two given numbers from a list sum up to a certain
         number n. repeats the process with a loop and making sure no similar
         results print out.
10.check maximum: the function checks 4 different inputs on the maximum
                  function, testing edge cases.(inputs specified in special
                  comments)
======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================
check maximum inputs:
1.[0] - checks if [0] returns 0 and not None as requested in the Targil.
2.[] - checks if [] returns None and not 0 as requested in the Targil.
3.[1,1,1] - a situation that was mentioned as an optional possibility in the
            Targil. checks if a list with identical components returns the
            component that is being repeated.
4.[0,0,0] - a combination of check no.1 and no.3. checks that 0 is returned
            and not None, even for multiple 0's.

Theoretical Questions:
1.cyclic(123 ,321) - an error will occur because 123 and 321 aren't lists
                     and they don't have lengths.
2.maximum([-3, -2, -1]) - wont cause an error, but will print 0 instead
                          of the correct solution (-1). that's because the
                          program wasn't meant to deal with negatives.
3.maximum([1, 10, 100, ‘intro’]) - will return an error because the str 'intro'
                                 cannot be compared to integers.
4.histogram(3, [1,2,3,4]) - will return an error because the given list will
                            create a new list with 4 components. that will
                            cause a problem with the given number 3.
5.prime_factors(0) - since 0 is smaller than i*i, the program will print 0
                     even though it isn't actually a prime. that's because
                     the code was programed to deal with numbers bigger or
                     equal to 1
6.pairs([0,0,1,1,2,2], 2) - since the numbers are shown more than once, the
                            loop will go over each and everyone of them, thus
                            returning copies of the same couples.
