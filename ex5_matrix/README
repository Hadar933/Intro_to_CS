I discussed the exercise with: Lab support.

FUNCTIONS SPECIFICATION:
word_file_locator(args):
    checks if a given file argument(wordlist) exists in the folder
matrix_file_locator(args):
    checks if a given file argument(matrix) exists in the folder
valid_direction(directions):
    checks if given direction(s) is(are) valid.
invalid_length(args):
    checks if the right amount of arguments is given
check_input_args(args):
    calls all previous functions to make sure conditions are met
read_wordlist_file(filename):
    converts the content of the word file to a workable list
read_matrix_file(filename):
     converts the content of the matrix file to a workable list
direction_:
    check for words in a given direction. runs over indexes depending on
    the given direction.
from_list_of_lists_to_list(list_of_list)
    converts a list of lists to a single list of items
list_to_tuple(list):
    converts a list to a tuple
find_words_in_matrix(word_list,matrix, directions):
    calls direction functions to check all given directions
write_output_file(results,output_filename):
    creates a new file containing the output of the previous function
main():
    calls all previous functions to run the program

CHECK WORDSEARCH

list_to_tuple_checker():
    checks the function list to tuple
==================
=  Description:  =
==================
CHECK WORDSEARCH CHECKS:
1.histogram_tuple[0] == ('dog',2)
    checks that the values of the list are tuples, and that they are
    arranged in the needed format - histogram list of the words
2.histogram_tuple[0][0] == ('dog')
    checks for the inned value of the tuple. has to be the word itself,
    and not the number that represents its occurrences.
3.histogram_tuple[0] != histogram_tuple[3]
    checks whether uppercase word are classified as different then lowercase
    ones. the function need to classify those from one another, and adhere
    different tuples to words with different letter-case
4.histogram_tuple[0][1] != histogram_tuple[1][1]
    checks if the number of times a word shows up increments when needed.
    in here, Ive tried to see if words that show up more then others
    do get the proper value.
