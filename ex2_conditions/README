==================
=  Description:  =
==================
1.far_to_cel:
    converts fahrenheit to celsius
2.calculate mathematical expression:
    a function that applies a given mathematical
    operation on two given numbers (not from user input)
3.calculate from string:
    a function that applies a given mathematical
    operation on two given numbers (from user input)
4.largest and smallest:
    without using max or min functions, decides which number
    is the biggest and which is the smallest among three
5.quadratic equation:
    solved the quadratic equation (not by user input)
6.quadratic equation:
    solved the quadratic equation (with user input)
7.shapes:
    calculates various shapes by getting information
    from the user.
8.stable_price:
    checks if a certain threshold is bigger or smaller
    than three given numbers
9.test largest and smallest:
    runs a test on function largest and smallest
    with 5 types of function inputs.

numbers chosen for question 9:
(-1, -2, -3) - tests if 3 negative numbers weren't causing
    errors.
(0, 0, 0) - checking 0 properties and also same number properties.
    wanted to make sure even though numbers are equal, an output
    will still go out.
(0.5, -1.7, 0) - different kinds of numbers. floats(positive or negative)
    and zero. (a somewhat combination of the previous two conditions)
(1/2, 1/4, 1/5) - wanted to check if a number can be represented as
    an operation between two numbers.
(-1/2, -2/4, -1/5) - was making sure negative operations will be shown
    as should be when comparing size (the smaller the fraction, the
    bigger the number)
